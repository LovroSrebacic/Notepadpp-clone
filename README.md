# Notepadpp-clone
Notepad++ clone made in java

## How it works
Using the application is straightforward. There is a menu bar as well as toolbar with all actions that you can do.<br />
In menu bar, next to the action name, there is a keyboard shortcut that you can use to perform that action.<br />
If you hover a couple of seconds above the action name, a short description will pop up that tells you what that action do, but if you hover above the button in toolbar, the description will pop up immediately.<br />
At the bottom of the screen there is a status bar that shows the length of a current document, current line and column of the cursor location and the length of selected text. There is also a current date and the local time.<br />

## Run the program
If you want to test the program yourself you'll need to have java installed on your computer.<br />
If you do have it, you can just run **Notepad++-clone.jar** which is located in root folder of this project.
